			<h2>Discussion of HW11 Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I added read indicators to messages. As part of my design for this feature, 
					I provide a toggle in the side-bar where users can select whether they would
					like their read receipts to be publically visible (i.e. other users
					can tell when they have read a message). When this value is true, the user's read
					receipts will be public and when this value is false, no one besides the user
					will be able to see their read receipts (this is controlled by the bto field in the 
					activity post). The data about the number of users that have seen a particular 
					message appears beneath that specific message in the chat. If the message has 
					not been viewed by anyone (other than the current user) who has their read receipts
					set to public, then the note "Unread by others" is displayed to the user under that message.
					Otherwise, the message will have a note like "Read by X" where X is the number of users
					that have publically viewed that particular message.
				</li>
				<li>
					I added the ability to reply to a message. The way I implemented this feature is closely
					related to the functionality that I wanted to provide in the original design of my chat
					app which allows users to organize their messages into threads. By replying to a message X,
					users are automatically creating a thread with message X as the base of that thread. The replies
					to message X will not show up in the main chat but will instead be collapsed into the thread
					beginning at message X. Currently, users can navigate to this thread in a couple of ways.
					The first way is by clicking on the "View Thread" button which appears underneath any message
					that serves as the base of a thread. This button will automatically switch the user to viewing
					that particular thread. Alternatively, users can navigate to the "Threads" page for any
					given context by clicking on the "Threads" button in the top right of the conversation panel.
					The Threads page shows all of the threads that have been created in that particular context
					with the name of the thread being the content of the base message. Clicking on any of these
					individual threads will allow the user to see all messages that have been sent in that thread.
					When on the Threads page, users can also navigate back to the main chat by clicking on the 
					"Return To Chat" button in the top right corner.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have added functionality that lets users choose a profile picture and displays the profile 
					pictures of other users. In the side panel of the chat app, I show an enlarged version of the
					current user's profile picture (or a default profile picture if they have never set
					their profile picture). I allow users to edit their profile picture by clicking on the "Edit Profile Picture"
					button below it. This allows the user to choose a new file which will be their new picture that
					will be displayed after it is successfully fetched. The profile picture of the current user
					and the profile pictures of all other users will show up next to their name underneath any
					messages that they send in the conversation.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Additional Features Added to Chat App</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In the private messaging section of my chat app, users need to specify
					the recipient that they would like to talk to. Originally, users needed to 
					specify the recipient using a long actor ID. In my improved design, I allow
					users to instead query for a particular recipient by inputting that 
					user's username. If the user does not have a username for some reason,
					then the user can instead find their recipient by inputting their actor ID. 
					This involves using the dropdown menu located before the input box and selecting 
					Actor ID then inputting the recipient's actor ID into the input box and submitting.
				</li>
				<li>
					I added several animations as part of HW11 Exercise 1 which improved the 
					visual components of my chat app and provided better feedback and visibility of system
					status to my users.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Future Work</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Allow users to reply without having to create a thread.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allow users to edit the title of threads to be something other than the content
					of the base message.
				</li>
				<li>
					Show the usernames of people who have read a particular message when hovering over
					the read receipt indicator.
				</li>
			</ul>
