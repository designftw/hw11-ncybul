					I added a horizontal shaking animation to the input boxes which gets
					activated when the user tries to request a username that is already taken or 
					when the user tries to specify a username for private messaging that does not exist.

					I added a transition of the background color and outline on hover to the two tabs which display the options for types of messaging (Channel-based
					vs. private messaging) to give users more feedback and reinforce the user's expectation of what will
					happen as they navigate between the two tabs.

					I added a bouncing motion to as well as changed the background color of the like button when it is clicked by the user in order to give
					them additional feedback when they have chosen to like a message which has the added benefit of being fun and playful.

					I added an animation which displays a helpful tooltip message when the user hovers over the 
					button to reply to a message which gives them additional information about what will
					happen if they choose to reply to that message.

					I added a sliding in and out animation to the title of a thread whenever the user navigates
					to or from a specific thread either after creating a new thread by replying or choosing
					a thread that already exists from the threads page in order to provide better feedback and visibility
					of system status to the user.
