					I added a horizontal shaking motion to the input boxes that allow users to request a new
					username or enter the username of the person they would like to private message which gets
					activated when the username is taken or when the username does not exist respectively.

					I added a transition of the background color and outline on hover to the two tabs which display the options for types of messaging (Channel-based
					vs. private messaging) to give users more feedback as they navigate between the two options.

					I added a sliding in and out animation to the title of a thread whenever the user navigates
					to or from a specific thread either after creating a new thread by replying or choosing
					a thread that already exists from the threads page.
