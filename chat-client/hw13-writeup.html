            <h2>My Design</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="emphasize">The Problem:</span> During my time at MIT, I have taken many classes within the EECS (Course 6)
                department in which students have created group chats to foster collaboration and
                question-answering among students in the class. Traditionally, these group chats are 
                created using a messaging app such as Messenger which is not designed for this
                specific use case and thus poses several problems. First, there is no central place
                to find existing group chats for a specific class since different apps may be used
                for different classes.
                Second, class group chats are not
                public which means that students in a class need to hear by word of mouth that a 
                group chat for the class exists or have a friend add them to the group chat. And finally,
                not all messaging platforms have useful tools for organizing messages within a group chat which
                makes these chats less effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="emphasize">My Solution:</span> My chat app solves all of the problems mentioned by providing a central place for students
                to create group chats for their Course 6 classes and organize separate conversations 
                within these group chats through the use of threads. The "Explore Groups" page is where
                a list of all class group chats can be found. These group chats are public and therefore can be
                searched through (using the search bar at the top) and joined by any other student using the app.
                Furthermore, no two group chats can have the same name which reduces the risk that two 
                group chats for the same class will be created. This system simplifies the process for
                students to create, find, and join class group chats that are of interest to them. Additionally,
                once a user has joined a class group chat, they can send messages in the main chat, or they
                can respond to another student's message which automatically creates a thread. This
                keeps messages organized and avoids spamming the main group chat with messages on a specific topic. 
                Users can find all threads created in a group chat by clicking on the "View All Threads" button
                at the top of the class group chat conversation. This brings up the threads page which lists all
                threads as buttons which the user can click to navigate directly to that thread. Also on this
                page is the option to create a new thread from scratch by clicking "New Thread" without
                having to reply to a message in the main conversation. This gives users more flexibility 
                with how they would like to organize messages and threads within a group. Overall, the problems
                of creating, finding, and joining class group chats as well as keeping these group chats
                organized are all addressed in my chat app.

            <h2>Changes Since Halfway Point</h2>
            <p>
                I completed all of the tasks which I listed in my HW12 writeup, and I also
                added some additional improvements based on feedback I received from my 
                previous submissions and discussions during studio. The full list of changes since my
                HW12 submission is below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I added a search feature to my Explore Groups page which helps
                    students find a specific class group chat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added a "Members" button at the top of all class group chats which shows
                    a full list of students in the group chat at that time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added the ability for users to create a new thread without having to reply to a
                    message in the main conversation. Threads that are created in this way do not link
                    to messages in the main conversation but rather can be accessed via the Threads page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added information about which actor created each thread on the Threads page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added confirm dialogs to prevent users from leaving group chats as
                    well as deleting threads or class group chats by accident.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I separated the "View Thread" button from the rest of the message buttons to
                    make this entry point directly to the thread more discoverable to users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I improved the formatting for editing messages to make it more consistent with the 
                    styling of my chat app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added a placeholder message for when the base of a thread is deleted by the 
                    actor who sent it. This is beneficial as it allows the sender to delete the 
                    base of a thread without removing the "View Thread" link for that
                    thread in the main conversation. Note that this change does not affect threads 
                    which are created without replying to a message in the main conversation as those
                    threads are only accessible from the Threads page and do not have a "base" message in
                    the main conversation.
                </li>
