            <h2>My Design</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="emphasize">The Problem:</span> During my time at MIT, I have taken many classes within the EECS (Course 6)
                department in which students have created group chats to foster collaboration and
                question-answering among students in the class. Traditionally, these group chats are 
                created using a messaging app such as Messenger which is not designed for this
                specific use case and thus poses several problems. First, there is no central place
                to find existing group chats for a specific class since different apps may be used
                for different classes.
                second, class group chats are not
                public which means that students in a class need to hear by word of mouth that a 
                group chat for the class exists or have a friend add them to the group chat. And finally,
                not all messaging platforms have useful tools for organizing messages within a group chat which
                makes these chats less effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="emphasize">My Solution:</span> My chat app solves all of the problems mentioned by providing a central place for students
                to create group chats for their Course 6 classes and organize separate conversations 
                within these group chats through the use of threads. The "Explore Groups" page is where
                a list of all class group chats can be found. These group chats are public and therefore can be
                searched through (using the search bar at the top) and joined by any other student using the app.
                Furthermore, no two group chats can have the same name which reduces the risk that two 
                group chats for the same class will be created. This system simplifies the process for
                students to create, find, and join class group chats that are of interest to them. Additionally,
                once a user has joined a class group chat, they can send messages in the main chat, or they
                can respond to another student's message which automatically creates a thread. This
                keeps messages organized and avoids spamming the main group chat with messages on a specific topic. 
                Users can find all threads created in a group chat by clicking on the "View All Threads" button
                at the top of the class group chat conversation. This brings up the threads page which lists all
                threads as buttons which the user can click to navigate directly to that thread. Also on this
                page is the option to create a new thread from scratch by clicking "New Thread" without
                having to reply to a message in the main conversation. This gives users more flexibility 
                with how they would like to organize messages and threads within a group. Overall, the problems
                of creating, finding, and joining class group chats as well as keeping these group chats
                organized are all addressed in my chat app.
