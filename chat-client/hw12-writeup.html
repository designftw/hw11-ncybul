            <h2>Plans for Final Design</h2>
            <p>
                The plans for my final design include many of the features that I initially specified in my
                Figma prototype. Since my chat app is intended to be used by MIT students in Course 6 to
                join class group chats and get their questions answered, I want my final design to 
                allow students to join these class group chats and create threads within these group chats
                for discussing specific questions in greater depth. These overarching features were included in my Figma
                design and will also be implemented in my final chat app design. I have, however, planned to make some changes to
                my chat app design. For example, I am no longer implementing the feature which allows students to 
                mark threads as resolved or unresolved. This decision is based on feedback I received from
                my user testing in which many users expressed confusion about why this option was helpful. I am also
                planning on changing the layout of several of my features, including the location of message
                controls since I now have controls for viewing a thread created from a specific message, replying to a message, liking a message,
                and potentially editing or deleting a message if the user is the original sender. Some of these features
                were not included in my original Figma design, so I had to adjust my design to fit them into the 
                user interface in an intuitive way. One way that I have simplified my design is that I am treating
                class group chats differently from direct messages. In my original design, I allowed users to 
                add direct message recipients to their sidebar in the same way that they can join classes and view
                all of their joined classes in the sidebar. Instead, my final design will use the original 
                infrastucture for direct messaging which involves having a recipient field where users can specify
                who they would like to chat with and populating the conversation with all of the messages between the
                user and the recipient once they have specified a valid recipient. Since I have limited time to 
                complete the chat app, I decided to focus most of my energy on implementing the class group chats
                and thread functionalities rather than focus on the direct messaging functionality since this is 
                not unique to my design or my use case.

            <h2>Halfway Point Progress</h2>
            <p>
                For my halfway point, I have completed the following tasks. These tasks represent a 
                suitable halfway point as I have already implemented the bulk of the functionality
                required of the two main features which I wanted to add into my chat app (class group
                chats and threads). I have also implemented much of the styling that I designed in my Figma
                prototype.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I have added functionality that allows users to view all
                    existing class group chats on the Explore Groups page, join classes from this page, leave
                    classes, and delete a class that has already been created (if they are the person who
                    created that group chat initially).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have implemented functionality which allows users to create threads in a particular context by replying
                    to a message in that conversation. Each class group chat or direct messaging conversation
                    will also have a page that shows all of the existing threads that have been created within that
                    conversation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added functionality that allows users to edit the title of a thread or delete a specific thread
                    (if they are the person who created that thread initially).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I aligned the styling of my chat app with my Figma design to the best of my ability to 
                    improve the usability of the chat app.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For the final design, I would like to complete the following tasks.
            </p>
			<ul>
                <li>
                    Add a search functionality to my Explore Groups page which will be helpful for finding
                    a specific class group chat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow users to see all members of a specific class group chat that they have joined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow users to reply to messages without creating a thread.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow users to create a new thread without having to reply to a message.
                </li>
			</ul>
